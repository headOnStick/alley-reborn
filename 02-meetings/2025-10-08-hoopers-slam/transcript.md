## Conversa

### 00:32 — André Costa
> I don't know if this guy knows this mic. Look at his face. Yeah, I think he knows it.

### 01:05 — Mike Yusay
> Hey Andrew how's it going?

### 01:07 — André Costa
> Hey Mike, how are you doing?

### 01:08 — Mike Yusay
> I'm doing well, how are you? Hi Ricardo.

### 01:12 — André Costa
> Nice to meet you. Great to connect. I think we have seen each other already in person, right? Once upon a time when I visited your offices to meet Miguel.

### 01:22 — Mike Yusay
> Oh, could be.

### 01:24 — André Costa
> I think you were there and we were briefly introduced. Yeah. Good to know. Mike thanks for finding the time; I think that PRC kind of briefed you about us and about what we were doing, but let me just start with the introduction. Ricardo is our Chief Commercial Officer, responsible for everything that involves our commercial efforts. Actually we are going to be in New York early November, so that might be a chance to visit you guys, explore in more detail what we are gonna talk today and maybe demo you some of the software we have been using.
>
> Let me contextualize why we reached out to PRC asking him for help. At Hoopers we have been evolving a lot in the last months. We were very focused on building this big basketball community and on the uses of technology for those efforts. First, we developed a product focused on gamifying the experience of fans in live events that we use in activation events and venues. The second product, and the reason why we wanted to talk with you, allows us to profile fans based on social media interactions so brands can have a better way to know, interact and explore value from the fan base.
>
> We are now expanding to other sports—soccer, football, baseball—so we are developing contacts and will be in New York hosting meetings. PRC has been following us for a while, even from an investment perspective. I reached out to understand how SLAM works in digital marketing, what tools you use, how you connect and understand the fan base on social media, and what pain points you feel. Maybe we can have a solution for some of these and plug in to help. That’s the idea for today’s call: learn from you how you operate. Ricardo, anything to add?

### 05:35 — Ricardo Presa
> Nothing to add at this stage. It would be lovely to understand your biggest pains and needs with fan data, fan intelligence.

### 05:44 — Mike Yusay
> For sure. The business is split between two main verticals. One is merchandise—t-shirts, clothing, apparel. There we use Shopify customer data to target ads in Google or Facebook. Our meta ads are based on our following. The other vertical is brand partnerships, where we partner with brands to create content and merge SLAM and their business in the basketball space.
>
> The pain point is that during proposals, brands ask for deep insights into our audience. We don't have specific tools beyond what the current platforms provide. We use Sprout to connect social accounts into one place for a cohesive dataset, but it’s still somewhat of a blind spot regarding who the followers are. In 2020 we ran a survey with Bastion DB5 that gave us insights such as household income, demographics, professions, basketball consumption, and perception of SLAM versus ESPN or Bleacher Report. That’s the most in-depth analysis we’ve had, but it’s five years old now. Understanding our followers is still very important, and applying that to apparel targeting would be a bonus.

### 09:49 — André Costa
> When you ran that survey, how big was the sample and how much did it cost?

### 10:04 — Mike Yusay
> It was before my time, but the sample size was about 2,000. The analysis might have cost five to ten thousand dollars. I can try to dig up specific numbers.

### 10:19 — André Costa
> Getting back to your process: when a brand like Nike approaches you for a campaign, what questions do they typically ask? How do you sell a project and where does data become important to increase the deal size? Could you give referrals—if we do a cover with Nike or a Nike athlete, what range are we talking about?

### 10:52 — Mike Yusay
> That kind of information is crucial with non-endemic brands. Nike knows what we do, so it’s not as hard a sell. But if Toyota comes to us, they ask how much of our audience are car enthusiasts or who drives a car. That’s where growth potential is highest because that information isn’t readily available. Google Analytics might have some of it, but accuracy is questionable. The same applies to banks like Chase or Morgan Stanley—they want to know interest in financial literacy. I’m usually not in the pitches but supply data if we have it. Those key points are critical in proposals, especially anything outside the basketball space.

### 13:46 — André Costa
> How many brands are you currently working with on these proposals?

### 13:55 — Mike Yusay
> This year we've had about 44 brand partnership deals, and 80–90% are non-endemic brands.

### 15:08 — André Costa
> Who typically presents the pitches and requests data?

### 15:39 — Mike Yusay
> There’s a team of about three people. David Schnur and Andrew Pitigorski lead it; they’re the main sellers. Josh Frolinger is the tactical person who learns what data is needed and requests it from me.

### 16:30 — André Costa
> Moving to merchandise: when you launch campaigns, how important is understanding consumer demand and hot topics? What data do you use?

### 17:12 — Mike Yusay
> Merchandise is less data-specific about what to launch. We’re tied to the editorial plan—magazines, collegiate space, licensing approvals. Decisions hinge on approvals from the NBA or universities. Data comes into play later when targeting schools or players. For example, a Cooper Flagg magazine did well in summer, dipped, and now sales pick up again, so we reactivate ads. It’s reactive and fast-paced; we lack additional insights beyond impressions and engagements. Insights into fan sentiment toward specific players or teams would guide us, but there are still challenges due to approvals.

### 21:35 — André Costa
> Final question: what is your marketing budget—tools and ads? Just to benchmark.

### 22:17 — Mike Yusay
> For tools, Sprout is really the only one—we pay around two to three thousand dollars a month. For ad spend, both verticals (merchandise and brand partnerships) spend about one million per year each, so roughly two million total, varying month to month.

### 23:39 — André Costa
> That’s helpful. About what we want to show you in New York: it would be great if you could bring someone from the editorial team. We understand communities, brands and teams; everyone wants fan data—who they are, how they behave, emotional connection. We built a fan intelligence platform profiling fans based on social media interactions, with more than 80 KPIs and 20+ emotional analyses live. It’s a live database giving triggers and information you need in real time.
>
> Everyone else hires a consulting firm, runs a survey, extrapolates. But audiences are on social media—that’s where people interact and expose their lives. We built a tool using public data and our own LLMs to process information, define patterns and collect additional info from bios, content, writing style and images, combining across channels to create a qualified fan data point you can use. We already work with clients and have millions of fans on the platform, and we want to partner with U.S. organizations to learn the market and build bridges into media and brands.
>
> We believe we can help you: provide fan data you’ve never seen, guide spend toward targets that engage more, support editorial decisions on covers, etc. We’d love to schedule an in-person meeting in New York (first days of November). We’ll be in Brooklyn—close to your Long Island office. We can demo the platform, show the data, discuss next steps and gather feedback.

### 28:48 — Mike Yusay
> That sounds amazing.

### 28:49 — André Costa
> Great. Once you see the platform you’ll have many ideas—we want your voice to help shape it. We’ll provide information you’re missing and adapt it to be helpful for daily operations.

### 29:28 — Mike Yusay
> Sounds great.

### 29:31 — André Costa
> I’ll follow up by email with our schedule and options to meet. In four days we plan 16 meetings, so locking your slot helps. We’ll send a one-pager with more information; the demo will show the rest.

### 30:05 — Mike Yusay
> I’ll talk to other team members to see if they can join. Hopefully we can all meet at the same time.

### 30:20 — André Costa
> Thank you, Mike.

### 30:22 — Mike Yusay
> Thank you so much.

### 30:25 — Encerramento
> Mutual goodbyes between André, Ricardo e Mike.
